In the reminder of this sections, you can see a display of some group, individual project work that I have done during my studies. At the moment it contains 3 parts.
 
### My first master thesis

Digitalization and its effect on country ecoonomic growth is a widely discussed topic, however, academic level research is less common.

### Time series analysis

Three reports were written.
- Analysis of global carbon budget (see [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xCMaEqdBvy_JfNY_qvkx63szHQ74-T1Y/view?usp=sharing)).
