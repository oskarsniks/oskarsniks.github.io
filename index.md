# Hi!

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! Here you can find some examples of my work during my MSc in Economics & Finance studies at [LUSEM](https://www.lusem.lu.se/) and (in a while you will see) some exciting projects that I am currently working on.

Feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oskarsniksmalnieks/) for job opportunities or interesting projects that you want me to participate in.

## LUSEM project examples
In the reminder of this section, you can see a display of some group/individual project work that I have done during my studies. At the moment it consists of 3 parts.
 
### My first master thesis

Digitalization and its effect on country economic growth is a widely discussed topic, however, academic level research is less common. In [my first master's thesis](https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/9026750) I investigate the aforementioned link and find that the true effect of ICT is still yet to come. (STATA code is available upon request.)

### Time series analysis

The following reports were written for [Time Series Analysis (NEKN34)](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lubas/i-uoh-lu-NEKN34) as a tool to learn some of core methods in the field. All quantitative aspects were done in R.

- Analysis of global carbon budget (see [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xCMaEqdBvy_JfNY_qvkx63szHQ74-T1Y/view?usp=sharing)). Is absorption rate of carbon dioxide slowing down? This report discusses that. _Learned methods/models: ARIMA, ACF and PACF tests._
- Replication of Tse (1998) and Tsui and Ho (2004) (see [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IEH1nK8cX9eEfR-TSr7d-BWtvsFt705q/view?usp=sharing)) This report is focused on replicating the aforementioned papers and their findings on conditional volatility. _Learned methods/models: GARCH (and similar extensions)._
- Is there a causal link between money supply and output? Our [analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nytTmRfPhAbkPnIHvwwCgFJpwxKWufvX/view?usp=sharing) investigates that. _Learned methods/models: VAR, VECM, Granger causality._

### Microeconometrics

To be added.

## Other projects

Whilst the former section addresses projects that are mostly of academic nature, here I elaborate on some of my recent/current projects.

### Debtor risk assessment

Debtor PD calculation is an interesting endeavour, which I am currently taking. Stay tuned!
