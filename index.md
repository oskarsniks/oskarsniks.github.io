# Hi!

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! Here you can find some examples of my work during my [MSc in Economics & Finance](https://lusem.lu.se/study/masters/programmes/economics/overview) studies at [LUSEM](https://www.lusem.lu.se/) and (in a while you will see) some exciting projects that I am currently working on.

Feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oskarsniksmalnieks/) for job opportunities or interesting projects that you want me to participate in. Also, my LinkedIn page is usually up to date with my latest certificates and such.

## LUSEM project examples
In the remainder of this section, you can see a display of some group/individual project work that I have done during my studies. At the moment it consists of 4 parts.

### My second master's thesis

_(My program requires writing two Master's thesis, one per each academic year)_ Corruption has been a widely discussed and analysed topic for decades. However, the results stemming from research on its effect are mixed and highly volatile, leading to a debate that it may be beneficial to the economy and society. [The thesis](https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/9054024) puts this to a test with a focus on Europe during 2005-2019.

### My first master's thesis

Digitalization and its effect on country economic growth is a widely discussed topic, however, academic level research is less common. In [my first master's thesis](https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/9026750) I investigate the aforementioned link and find that the true effect of ICT is still yet to come. (STATA code is available upon request.)

### Time series analysis

The following reports were written for [Time Series Analysis (NEKN34)](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lubas/i-uoh-lu-NEKN34) as a tool to learn some of the core methods in the field. All quantitative aspects were done in R.

- Analysis of global carbon budget (see [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xCMaEqdBvy_JfNY_qvkx63szHQ74-T1Y/view?usp=sharing)). Is the absorption rate of carbon dioxide slowing down? This report discusses that. _Learned methods/models: ARIMA, ACF and PACF tests._
- Replication of Tse (1998) and Tsui and Ho (2004) (see [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IEH1nK8cX9eEfR-TSr7d-BWtvsFt705q/view?usp=sharing)) This report is focused on replicating the aforementioned papers and their findings on conditional volatility. _Learned methods/models: GARCH (and similar extensions)._
- Is there a causal link between money supply and output? Our [brief analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nytTmRfPhAbkPnIHvwwCgFJpwxKWufvX/view?usp=sharing) investigates that. _Learned methods/models: VAR, VECM, Granger causality._

### Microeconometrics

[Microeconometrics](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lubas/i-uoh-lu-NEKN33) was a highly empirical and research-focused course. Research design, causality, IVs and some other applied tools were discussed and replicated.

### Financial Valuation and Risk Management

[The course](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lubas/i-uoh-lu-NEKN83) mainly focused on PD, LGD and VaR, ES simulations/analysis. [The first report (out of six)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oNo6UT5lt_oIwZ8G-QTQFDdnXSG_W2g8/view?usp=sharing)  focused on simple parametric methods to estimate VaR.

## Other projects

Whilst the former section addresses projects that are mostly academic, here I elaborate on some of my recent/current projects, including some interesting questions that I may write a blog post about (see [here](https://www.oskarsniks.blogspot.com)).

### Debtor risk assessment

Debtor PD calculation can be a complex project. Stay tuned for more.

### Forecasting Latvia's economic performance

This idea aims to connect to World Bank and Eurostat database API to create a model that without any manual work updates data to calculate GDP forecasts.
